## 📖 About

**Clipaste** is a privacy-first clipboard manager for macOS and Windows. It keeps a secure, searchable history of everything you copy: text, URLs, images and files. Whether you are a developer, designer or writer, Clipaste helps you organize your snippets and speed up your daily tasks. With powerful search tools, smart bookmarking and drag-n-drop, you can retrieve anything from your clipboard history in seconds. All your sensitive data stays on your device and is encrypted by default.

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

Clipaste was built on a zero-trust architecture: no analytics, no user accounts, and no servers. All clipboard data is stored locally on your computer and is encrypted at rest using AES-256 (keys managed by the OS Keychain and are linked to your system account).

  * **Local Only:** Your data is stored 100% on your device.
  * **Encrypted:** History is secured with AES-256 encryption by default.
  * **No Cloud:** We never upload your data. No servers, no accounts, no tracking.

## ✨ Key Features

  * **Non-Intrusive:** Copy from any app and use clipboard history only when needed.
  * **Multi-Format Support:** Works seamlessly with text, formatted text, images, and files.
  * **Smart Search:** Find any clip by typing words it might contain.
  * **Filter by App:** Quickly see "only links copied from Chrome" or "images from Photoshop".
  * **Favorites:** Pin your most-used snippets for quick access.
  * **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Paste previous items without touching your mouse.
  * **Drag & Drop:** Drag items from history directly into other apps.
  * **Beautiful UI:** Clean, modern look with blur, animations and dark mode.
  * **Cross-Platform:** A unified experience on both Windows and macOS.
